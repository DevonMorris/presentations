## Mirror of the mind

## Partner in Communication
> That slip boxes can be recommended as partners of communication is first of
> all due to a simple problem about technical and economic theoretical
> research. It is impossible to think without writing; at least it is
> impossible in any sophisticated or networked fashion.

## Partner in Communication
> One of the most basic presuppositions of communication is that the partners
> can mutually surprise each other. Only in the way can information be produced
> in the respective other. Information is an intra-systematic event. It results
> when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities.
