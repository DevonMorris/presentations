# Presentations

These are presenations that I give. They are generated from markdown using
pandoc and I usually choose `reveal.js` as the output because it generally
looks good and supports `mp4` playback.

Each presentation should have an associated makefile.

## Requirements

Latest [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) (or at least greater than 2.9)
