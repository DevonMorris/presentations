# Geometry

## Geometry

> Concerned with properties of space that are related with distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures.

## Euler Angles - Scaling

## Euler Angles - Addition

## What is this?

<insert 3 numbers>

## Blunder #1

Don't confuse the representation of a thing for the thing itself!

## Numbers!

## Bases

## Change of basis

## What is a this?

<insert array 3x3 numbers>

## Matrix

Matrices are actually "vectors" in their own right.

## Linear Transformations

<linear transformations of column vectors>

## Linear Transformations

<linear transformations of row vectors>

## Change of Basis

## Quadratic Form

## Isomorphic

Means there exists a transformation that preserves structure.

$$
U \cong V
$$

## Quick Fact

If $V$ is finite dimensional real vector space then

$$
V \cong \mathbb{R}^n
$$


# Manifolds

## Think Curvy Space

<insert picture of curvy space>

## Charts
